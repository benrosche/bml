### Bayesian multiple-membership multilevel models with parameterizable weight function.

## bml: Bayesian Multiple-Membership Multilevel Models with Endogenous Weights

`bml` is an R package for fitting *Bayesian multiple-membership
multilevel models with endogenous weights* (“extended MMMM”) via JAGS.
It supports a range of outcome types—including linear, logit,
conditional logit, and survival models (Cox and Weibull)—and is designed
for settings where researchers want to model how multiple units at a
lower level jointly influence outcomes at a higher level.

In most multilevel analyses, the primary focus is on how higher-level
contextual units (e.g., neighborhoods, schools, countries) shape
outcomes observed at lower levels (e.g., individuals, students,
governments), reflecting a macro-to-micro perspective. bml turns this
logic around. Through an extended multiple-membership multilevel model,
it allows researchers to explicitly model how the combined influence of
many lower-level units propagates “upwards” to a higher-level outcome,
enabling the study of micro-to-macro relationships.

Traditional approaches to micro-macro questions either:

- aggregate lower-level variables to the higher level (risking
  aggregation bias), or
- disaggregate higher-level outcomes to the lower level (artificially
  inflating sample size).

Both strategies obscure the underlying aggregation process, ignore the
statistical dependencies present in the data, and prevent the
decomposition of variance across levels. In contrast, the extended MMMM
implemented in `bml` explicitly models aggregation through a weight
function that may itself depend on parameters and covariates. This
approach provides a theoretically grounded and statistically principled
framework for studying micro-macro relationships using regression
models.

### With the bml package, you can

- **Model how lower-level units jointly shape higher-level outcomes:**
  For example, how political parties shape coalition outcomes, how
  family members influence household decisions, and how subunits jointly
  shape organizational performance.

- **Compare and estimate aggregation functions:** Test whether
  higher-level outcomes depend on the mean, sum, minimum, maximum, or
  other functions of lower-level features, instead of imposing a
  predefined aggregation.

- **Endogenize the weight matrix:** Rather than imposing a fixed spatial
  or network weight matrix, allow connection strengths to be
  endogenously determined as functions of covariates.

- **Account for complex dependence structures:** Simultaneously
  accommodate hierarchical, cross-classified, and multiple-membership
  structures, accounting for dependence patterns missed by conventional
  models and cluster-robust SEs.

- **Partition variance across levels:** Estimate residual variance at
  lower and higher levels to see how much heterogeneity is attributable
  to each level in your data.

### Where can you use bml?

Multiple-membership structures are common across the social sciences and
beyond. The model was developed for coalition government data, but the
same structure appears in many other settings, such as:

- **International relations:** Multi-party conflicts, alliances and
  treaties, as well as international organizations with overlapping
  memberships.

- **Multi-level systems:** Subnational units (e.g., regions, states,
  municipalities) that jointly shape national outcomes and may
  simultaneously participate in multiple higher-level arrangements.

- **Organization research:** Individuals who shape team- and firm-level
  outcomes and may simultaneously participate in multiple teams, as well
  as organizations engaged in joint ventures or other
  interorganizational collaborations.

- **Spatial research:** Neighborhoods or regions whose outcomes depend
  on the combined influence of surrounding areas. Here, bml allows the
  spatial weight matrix to be endogenized rather than imposed ex ante.

- **Network applications:** Actors whose outcomes depend on the combined
  influence of their network neighbors (e.g., social, collaboration, or
  communication ties). While similar ideas have been explored in earlier
  work (e.g., Tranmer et al. 2014), bml extends this by allowing the
  network weight matrix to be endogenized rather than imposed ex ante.

In all these cases, bml provides tools to model dependence and
interdependence: not just correcting standard errors for clustering, but
explicitly representing how lower-level units combine to produce
higher-level outcomes.

The following command fits an MMMM to coalition government data,
modeling each coalition’s outcome as an equal-weighted combination of
member parties’ organizational structure and random effects.

``` r

bml(
  Y ~ 1 +
    majority +
    mm(
      id = id(pid, gid),
      vars = vars(org_structure),
      fn = fn(w ~ 1 / n, c = TRUE),
      RE = TRUE
    ),
  family = "Gaussian",
  data = coalgov
) |>
  summary()
```

Parties (`pid`) can appear in multiple governments (`gid`), and the
party-level covariate `org_structure` enters the model through the
multiple-membership term
[`mm()`](https://benrosche.github.io/bml/reference/mm.md). The weights
are set to `w ~ 1 / n` (equal weights across the n parties in a
coalition), and party-specific random effects are included via
`RE = TRUE`.
