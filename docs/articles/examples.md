I present three examples to demonstrate how the MMMM can be applied to
analyze aggregation, network, and spatial analyses.

- [Example 1: Political Parties and the Survival of Coalition
  Governments](#e1) (aggregation regression)
- [Example 2: All Friends or Just Your Best Friend?](#e2) (network
  regression)
- [Example 3: Air Quality and Home Values](#e3) (spatial regression)
