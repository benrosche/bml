\title{School networks data from CILS4EU study}
\format{
Two data objects are provided:

\strong{nodedat}: Node-level (student) attributes
\describe{
  \item{youthid}{Integer. Student identifier (unique across all schools)}
  \item{schoolid}{Integer. School identifier}
  \item{classid}{Integer. Classroom identifier}
  \item{sex}{Factor. Student gender}
  \item{etn}{Factor. Ethnicity or immigrant background}
  \item{parent_edu}{Numeric. Parental education level}
  \item{parent_inc}{Numeric. Parental income}
  \item{test_lang}{Numeric. Language test score}
  \item{test_cogn}{Numeric. Cognitive test score}
}

\strong{edgedat}: Edge-level (friendship) data
\describe{
  \item{youthid_from}{Integer. Nominator (student reporting friendship)}
  \item{youthid_to}{Integer. Nominee (student nominated as friend)}
  \item{rank}{Integer. Ranking of friendship nomination}
}

An object of class \code{tbl_df} (inherits from \code{tbl}, \code{data.frame}) with 18314 rows and 3 columns.

\description{
Network and survey data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in
Four European Countries (CILS4EU). The data include friendship networks among
students nested within classrooms and schools, along with individual-level
characteristics and outcomes. Structured for hierarchical and multiple-membership
network models.
}
\details{
This dataset is designed for social network analysis with multilevel structure:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Level 1:} Students (nodes)
  \item \strong{Level 2:} Classrooms
  \item \strong{Level 3:} Schools
}

Students can form friendships both within and across classrooms (though primarily
within classrooms). This creates opportunities for modeling peer effects, social
influence, and network formation processes using multiple-membership or hierarchical
specifications.

\strong{Potential Applications:}
\itemize{
  \item Peer influence on academic performance
  \item Homophily in friendship formation
  \item Cross-level interactions (school/classroom effects on peer networks)
  \item Multiple-membership models where students are influenced by multiple peers
