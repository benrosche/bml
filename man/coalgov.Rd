\title{Coalition Governments in Western Democracies (1944-2014)}
\format{
A tibble with 2,077 rows and 21 variables. Each row represents a party's
  participation in a specific coalition government. The sample contains 628 governments
  formed by 312 unique parties across 29 countries.

\strong{Identifiers:}
\describe{
  \item{gid}{Government identifier (group-level unit in \code{mm()} specification).
    Range: [3, 1105]}
  \item{pid}{Party identifier (member-level unit in \code{mm()} specification).
    Range: [11110, 96955]}
  \item{cid}{Country identifier (nesting-level unit in \code{hm()} specification).
    Range: [11, 96]}
  \item{country}{Three-letter country code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-3)}
  \item{pname}{Full party name}
}

\strong{Government-level variables:}
\describe{
  \item{pelection}{Date of the preceding election that led to the government's formation.
    Range: [1939-04-02, 2014-12-14]}
  \item{n}{Number of parties in the coalition (group size for weight functions).
    Range: [2, 9], mean: 3.31}
  \item{dur_wkb}{Government duration in days, measured from investiture to termination
    (outcome variable for survival models). Range: [7, 1840], mean: 554.5}
  \item{event_wkb}{Early termination indicator: 1 = government terminated due to
    political conflict (voluntary resignation, dissension within government, lack of
    parliamentary support, or head of state intervention) more than one year before
    the official end of term; 0 = censored (regular elections, other reasons, or
    termination within one year of scheduled elections). Range: [0, 1], mean: 0.39}
  \item{comp_early}{Early election indicator for competing risks analysis: 1 = government
    terminated by calling early elections, 0 = otherwise. Sourced from WKB.
    Range: [0, 1], mean: 0.04}
  \item{comp_replace}{Nonelectoral replacement indicator for competing risks analysis:
    1 = government terminated by nonelectoral replacement (cabinet reshuffle without
    elections), 0 = otherwise. Sourced from WKB. Range: [0, 1], mean: 0.36}
  \item{majority}{Majority government indicator: 1 = coalition controls majority of
    parliamentary seats, 0 = minority government. Range: [0, 1], mean: 0.80}
  \item{mwc}{Minimal winning coalition indicator: 1 = coalition would lose its majority
    if any party left, 0 = oversized coalition. Range: [0, 1], mean: 0.35}
  \item{rile_SD}{Inter-party ideological heterogeneity. Standard deviation of coalition
    parties' left-right positions (from CMP) relative to the ideological distribution
    of all parties in parliament. Standardized and inverted so higher values indicate
    greater ideological cohesion. Range: [-8.40, 2.12], mean: 0.04}
}

\strong{Country-level variables:}
\describe{
  \item{investiture}{Investiture vote requirement (time-constant country characteristic):
    1 = country requires formal parliamentary investiture vote, 0 = no formal requirement.
    Range: [0, 1], mean: 0.46}
}

\strong{Party-level variables:}
\describe{
  \item{pseat}{Party's proportional seat share within the coalition.
    Range: [0.00, 73.00], mean: 0.22}
  \item{prime}{Prime minister party indicator: \code{TRUE} = party holds prime
    ministership (n = 628), \code{FALSE} = junior coalition partner (n = 1,449)}
  \item{cohesion}{Intra-party ideological cohesion, measured using an adaptation of
    the Cowles-Jones ratio. Computed as the ratio of continuous ideological shifts
    to reversals in a party's left-right position over time. Higher values indicate
    more consistent ideological trajectories (greater cohesion). Standardized.
    Range: [-1.13, 3.85], mean: 0.00}
  \item{rile}{Party's left-right ideological position (from CMP). Measured on a
    continuous scale where higher values indicate more right-wing positions and lower
    values indicate more left-wing positions. Standardized.
    Range: [-3.21, 3.68], mean: 0.00}
  \item{finance}{Party's economic dependence on member contributions (from PPDB).
    Measured as the share of party funding from member dues relative to total income.
    Standardized; higher values indicate greater dependence on member financing.
    Treated as time-constant due to data limitations. Range: [-0.98, 4.40], mean: 0.00}
  \item{Nmembers}{Number of party members (from PPDB). Standardized; treated as
    time-constant due to data limitations. Range: [-0.33, 15.02], mean: 0.00}
}

\description{
A dataset containing information on coalition governments and their member parties
across 30 parliamentary democracies. The data are in long format where the unit of
analysis is parties in governments, making it suitable for multiple-membership
multilevel models where governments (groups) are composed of multiple parties (members).
}
\details{
This dataset demonstrates multiple-membership multilevel modeling where:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Members:} Political parties (identified by \code{pid})
  \item \strong{Groups:} Coalition governments (identified by \code{gid})
  \item \strong{Nesting:} Governments nested within countries (identified by \code{cid})
}

Each coalition government comprises multiple parties, and parties can participate in
multiple governments over time. This creates a multiple-membership structure where
party-level characteristics are aggregated to the government level using weighting
functions specified in \code{mm()} blocks.

\strong{Sample:} After matching party data across sources and excluding single-party
and caretaker governments, the sample comprises 628 governments formed by 312 unique
parties across 29 countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech
Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel,
Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania,
Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom.

\strong{Measurement notes:}
\itemize{
  \item Government duration follows the WKB convention: time from investiture to
    termination or new elections
  \item Early termination events focus on political gridlock (conflict-related endings)
    and exclude terminations within one year of scheduled elections
  \item \code{comp_early} and \code{comp_replace} enable competing risks analysis
    distinguishing between termination mechanisms
  \item Party-level variables (\code{cohesion}, \code{finance}, \code{Nmembers}) are
    standardized (mean = 0) for analysis
