\title{Coalition governments in comparative perspective (1944-2013)}
\format{
A data frame with 1,286 rows and 27 variables. Each row represents a party's
  participation in a specific government:
\describe{
  \item{pid}{Integer. Party identifier (member-level unit in mm() specification)}
  \item{pname}{Character. Party name}
  \item{gid}{Integer. Government identifier (group-level unit in mm() specification)}
  \item{gname}{Character. Government name}
  \item{cid}{Integer. Country identifier (nesting-level unit in hm() specification)}
  \item{cname}{Character. Country name}
  \item{gstart}{Date. Government start date}
  \item{gend}{Date. Government end date}
  \item{n}{Integer. Number of parties in the government (group size for weight functions)}
  \item{prime}{Integer. Prime minister party indicator}
  \item{pfam}{Character. Party family}
  \item{rile}{Numeric. Party's right-left ideological position}
  \item{ipd}{Numeric. Intra-party democracy score}
  \item{fdep}{Numeric. Party's financial dependency}
  \item{pseatrel}{Numeric. Party's relative seat share within coalition}
  \item{majority}{Integer. Majority government indicator: 1 = government controls majority
    of seats, 0 = minority government}
  \item{mwc}{Integer. Minimal winning coalition indicator}
  \item{hetero}{Numeric. Ideological heterogeneity within government}
  \item{investiture}{Numeric. Investiture vote requirement at country level}
  \item{pmpower}{Numeric. Prime ministerial powers at country level}
  \item{earlyterm}{Integer. Early termination indicator: 1 = government terminated early,
    0 = government completed full term (event indicator for survival models)}
  \item{govdur}{Numeric. Government duration in days (outcome variable for survival models)}
  \item{govmaxdur}{Numeric. Maximum possible government duration in days}
  \item{sim.w}{Numeric. Simulated weights for demonstration purposes}
  \item{sim.y}{Numeric. Simulated linear outcome}
  \item{sim.st}{Numeric. Simulated survival time}
  \item{sim.e}{Integer. Simulated event status}

\description{
A dataset containing information about political parties participating in coalition
governments across multiple countries and time periods. The data are structured at
the party-government level (member level), making it suitable for multiple-membership
multilevel models where governments (groups) are composed of multiple parties (members).
}
\details{
This dataset is particularly useful for demonstrating multiple-membership models where:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Members:} Political parties (identified by \code{pid})
  \item \strong{Groups:} Coalition governments (identified by \code{gid})
  \item \strong{Nesting:} Governments nested within countries (identified by \code{cid})
}

Each government can have multiple parties, and parties can participate in multiple
governments over time. This creates a multiple-membership structure where party-level
characteristics need to be aggregated to the government level using appropriate
weighting functions.
