\title{Fix a coefficient to a known value}
\usage{
fix(var, value)
}
\arguments{
\item{var}{Unquoted variable name from your data}

\item{value}{Numeric value for the coefficient (e.g., \code{1.0} for a standard offset)}
}
\value{
A \code{bml_fix} object that can be used within \code{\link{vars}}.
}
\description{
Specify a covariate whose coefficient should be held constant at a fixed value
rather than estimated from the data. This is useful for offset variables or
when you want to impose theoretical constraints. Fixed coefficients are
handled efficiently by pre-computing their contribution in R before passing
data to JAGS.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Fix a coefficient to 1.0 (standard offset)
fix(exposure, 1.0)

# Use within vars() for multiple-membership models
vars(fix(population, 0.5) + income + education)
}
