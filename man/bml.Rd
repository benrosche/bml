\arguments{
\item{formula}{A symbolic model formula. The left-hand side specifies the outcome
(e.g., \code{Y} or \code{survival::Surv(time, event)}), and the right-hand side includes fixed
effects and membership structures, for example:
\code{1 + X.L2 + X.L3 + mm(id(l1id, l2id), mmc(X.L1), mmw(w ~ 1/N)) + hm(id = l3id, type = RE)}.
Use standard formula syntax; \code{I()} is not supported inside \code{bml()}—create transformed
and interaction variables in the data before modeling.}

\item{family}{A character string specifying the model family. Supported options are
\code{"Gaussian"}, \code{"Binomial"}, \code{"Weibull"}, and \code{"Cox"}.
(Not yet implemented: \code{"CondLogit"}.)}

\item{priors}{A named list or character vector mapping parameter groups to JAGS priors.
For example: \code{priors = list("b.l1" = "dnorm(0,0.01"))}.
See “More details on priors” in the package documentation.}

\item{inits}{A list of initial values used for all chains. If \code{NULL}, suitable
initial values are chosen automatically by JAGS.}

\item{n.iter}{Total number of MCMC iterations.}

\item{n.burnin}{Number of burn-in iterations to discard.}

\item{n.thin}{Thinning rate for MCMC sampling.}

\item{chains}{Number of MCMC chains to run.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducibility.}

\item{run}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), JAGS is executed to estimate the model.}

\item{monitor}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, additional components (weights, random effects,
predictions, and raw JAGS output) are stored in the result object.}

\item{modelfile}{Character or logical. If \code{TRUE}, the generated JAGS model is saved
to \code{bml/temp/modelstring.txt}. If a file path is provided, \code{bml()} will
use that file instead of generating new JAGS code and only build the data structure.
Use \code{.libPaths()} to locate package storage directories.}

\item{data}{A data frame where each row represents a level-1 observation (the unit of analysis).}
}
\value{
A list containing the following elements:
\itemize{
  \item \code{reg.table} — Regression results summary.
  \item \code{w} — Estimated weights.
  \item \code{re.l1} — Level-1 random effects (if specified).
  \item \code{re.l3} — Level-3 random effects (if specified).
  \item \code{pred} — Posterior predictions (linear predictor for Gaussian models;
        survival time for Weibull models).
  \item \code{input} — Internally created model variables.
  \item \code{jags.out} — Raw, unformatted JAGS output.
}

If \code{monitor = FALSE}, only \code{reg.table} is returned.
}
\description{
The \strong{bml} package provides a user-friendly interface for fitting Bayesian multiple-membership
multilevel models with parameterizable weight functions via JAGS.

JAGS must be installed separately: \url{https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/}.
}
\details{
In addition to hierarchical and cross-classified multilevel models, the \strong{bml} package allows
users to fit Bayesian multiple-membership models. Unlike tools such as
\code{\link[brms]{brms}} or MLwiN (\url{https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/software/mlwin/}),
\strong{bml} lets users specify and estimate models in which membership weights are parameterized
through flexible formula syntax. This enables a more nuanced examination of how effects from
lower-level units aggregate to higher levels (the micro–macro link).

The package automatically generates JAGS code to fit the model and processes the output
to facilitate interpretation of model parameters and diagnostics.

For accessible introductions to multiple-membership models, see Fielding and Goldstein (2006)
and Beretvas (2010). Advanced treatments include Goldstein (2011, Ch. 13),
Rasbash and Browne (2001, 2008), Browne et al. (2001), and Leckie (2013).
The package and modeling framework are introduced in:
Rosche, B. (2025). \emph{A Multilevel Model for Coalition Governments: Uncovering Party-Level
Dependencies Within and Between Governments}. \emph{Political Analysis}.

\section{Formula Components}{

\itemize{
  \item \strong{Outcome (Y):} The dependent variable. For survival models, use \code{Surv(time, event)}.
  \item \strong{Intercept (1):} Includes an intercept term; use \code{0} to omit it.
  \item \strong{Level-2 predictors (X.L2):} Variables defined at level 2, separated by \code{+}.
  \item \strong{Level-3 predictors (X.L3):} Variables defined at level 3, separated by \code{+}.
  \item \strong{Multiple membership object (\code{mm()}):} Defines how lower-level (level-1) units are
        associated with higher-level (level-2) constructs using a user-specified weighting function
        (see details below).
  \item \strong{Hierarchical membership (\code{hm()}):} Specifies nesting of level-2 units within
        level-3 entities. Cross-classified structures can be modeled by including multiple \code{hm()} objects.
}

\strong{Important:} The formula parser does not support \code{I()} inside \code{bml()}.
Create transformations and interactions in your data before modeling.
}

\section{Multiple Membership Object \code{mm()}}{

\preformatted{
mm(
  id  = id(l1id, l2id),
  mmc = mmc(X.L1),     # level-1 covariates to aggregate
  mmw = mmw(w ~ 1 / N, constraint = 1, ar = FALSE)
)
}

\strong{Components:}
\itemize{
  \item \code{id(l1id, l2id)}: Specifies identifiers linking each level-1 unit (\code{l1id})
        to its corresponding level-2 entities (\code{l2id}).
  \item \code{mmc(X.L1)}: Specifies level-1 covariates aggregated across memberships.
        No intercept is allowed and interactions must be precomputed.
        If omitted, only the random-effects structure is modeled.
  \item \code{mmw(w ~ ..., constraint, ar)}: Defines the weight function (micro–macro link).
}

\strong{Weight function details:}
\itemize{
  \item The right-hand side specifies how weights (\code{w}) are estimated. The function may be nonlinear
        and can include variables and parameters, provided it is identifiable and bounded.
  \item Must follow standard formula syntax.
  \item Parameters should be named \code{b1}, \code{b2}, \code{b3}, etc.
  \item Variables without explicit parameters are interpreted as \code{1 * X}, similar to an offset term.
  \item Each parameter must have a corresponding prior, and priors must be compatible with the specified
        weight function (see Tips below).
  \item \strong{Default:} If \code{mmw()} is omitted, equal weights (\code{w ~ 1 / N}) are assumed.
        Note that \code{N} is created internally.
  \item \strong{Generalized logistic example (Rosche, 2025):}
        \code{w ~ 1 / (1 + (N - 1) * exp(-(b1 * X1 + b2 * X2 + ...)))}.
}

\strong{Constraint option:}
\itemize{
  \item \code{constraint = TRUE} (default): Weights for each level-2 entity sum to 1.
  \item \code{constraint = FALSE}: Weights are not constrained to sum to 1. This may lead to
        different scaling of aggregated covariates relative to their level-1 counterparts.
}

\strong{Autoregressive random effects option:}
\itemize{
  \item \code{ar = TRUE}: Allows level-1 random effects to vary across level-2 entities as a random walk,
        with each effect centered on the corresponding entity’s effect from the previous instance.
  \item \code{ar = FALSE} (default): Assumes a single random effect per level-1 unit.
}
}

\section{Hierarchical Membership Object \code{hm()}}{

\preformatted{
hm(id = l3id, name = l3name, type = RE, showFE = FALSE)
}

\strong{Components:}
\itemize{
  \item \code{id = l3id}: Variable identifying level-3 groups.
  \item \code{name = l3name}: Optional labels for level-3 units.
  \item \code{type}: \code{"RE"} (default) or \code{"FE"}.
        \itemize{
          \item If \code{"FE"} is selected, each level-3 unit has its own intercept, and any level-3 predictors
                are omitted. The first \code{l3id} serves as the reference category.
          \item If \code{"RE"} is selected, a normally distributed random-effects term is estimated.
        }
  \item \code{showFE}: If \code{TRUE} and \code{type = "FE"}, report the fixed effects; otherwise omit (default).
}
}

\section{Supported Families / Links}{

\itemize{
  \item Gaussian (continuous): \code{family = "Gaussian"}
  \item Binomial (logistic): \code{family = "Binomial"}
  \item Weibull survival: \code{family = "Weibull"}, outcome: \code{Surv(time, event)}
  \item Cox survival: \code{family = "Cox"}, outcome: \code{Surv(time, event)}
  \item Not yet implemented: \code{family = "CondLogit"}
}
}

\section{Priors}{

Priors can be specified for the following parameters: \code{b.l1}, \code{b.l2}, \code{b.l3}, \code{b.w},
\code{tau.l1}, \code{tau.l2}, and \code{tau.l3}.

Supply a list of character strings, for example:
\preformatted{
priors = list("b.l1~dnorm(0,0.01)", "tau.l1~dscaled.gamma(25,1)")
}
For more details on priors in JAGS, see the
\href{https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/Manuals/4.x/jags_user_manual.pdf}{JAGS User Manual}.
}

\section{Tips}{

\itemize{
  \item \strong{JAGS error on \code{w[i]} nodes:} The weight function must produce values consistent with the priors of all parameters.
        Negative or unbounded weights can push parameters outside their prior support, causing errors.
        Ensure weights sum to 1 and remain properly bounded. Standardizing variables (where appropriate) can help.
  \item \strong{Weight regressors:} Including regressors in the weight function increases model complexity and data demands.
        Start with moderately informative priors, for example: \code{priors = list("b.w" = "dnorm(0,0.1"))},
        and relax precision gradually as the model stabilizes.
  \item \strong{Input data:} The input data frame must represent level-1 units (one row per level-1 observation).
        All transformed and interaction variables should be precomputed before fitting the model.
